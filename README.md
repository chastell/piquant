Piquant
=======

Piquant is a Ruby library for accessing [Raw Salad](https://github.com/CCLab/Raw-Salad) data (mostly Polish governmental budget data at the moment).

Piquant is quite useless for now.

To do
-----

* retrieve datasets
* retrieve views
* retrieve issues
* stub out HTTP traffic in specs
